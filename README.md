## Module 3 assignment - Ryan Kincheloe

This is the information about the repository and files in Ryan Kincheloes Python challenge, module 3 assignment. We have 2 scripts, one looking at financial data, PyBank, and the other looking at election data, PyPoll.

## PyBank
Pybank loops through the assoiciated csv (budget_data.csv) found in the PyBank resoursces folder, and analyzes the data and calculates following metrics.

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


Once these results are printed to the terminal, the script writes that infrmation into a new text file, titled "Financial_Analysis.txt" inside the PyBank analysis folder.


## PyPoll
PyPoll loops through the second associated csv (election_data.csv) found in the PyPoll resources folder, and analyzes the data and calculates following metrics.

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

Once these results are printed to the terminal, the script writes that infrmation into a new text file, titled "Election_Analysis.txt" inside the PyPoll analysis folder.
